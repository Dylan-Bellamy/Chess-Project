# Final Project - Chess 

## Purpose

This is a past private repository to build a replica chess game. We had the hopes of implementing low-level AI, but could not reach such a goal in our tight schedule. 

## Features 

- Implemented all basic chess piece moves
- Added the ability to castle
- 2-Player Game, with main menu, start button, and help menu
- Incorporated the Strategy Design Pattern 

## Insights

This past repository had two contributors, being myself and a friend of mine
